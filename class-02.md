CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed.

in every element in CSS, there's Selector and Declaration

* **element** the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.

* **Declarations** indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.

1- External :
in its way you should use the link and but it in ```<head>``` element to tell the browser where to find the CSS file

2- INTERNAL :
in this way you can use ```<style>``` element inside ```<head>``` element

3- INLINE :
in this way you can but ```<style>``` tag inside any element and this way is not preferred to use
