# LISTS:

## lists use in HTML to make items more Organizers and there are types of lists :
1. ordered list :
show numbers beside the text 
2. unordered list :
show points beside the text and there's another style for unordered list 
and anything put in this lists you should put it between an opening ```<li>```
tag and a closing ```<li >``` tag
3. definition lists 
The definition list is created with
the ```<dl>``` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
 - ```<dt>```
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
- ```<dd>```
This is used to contain the
definition.

and you can put a second list inside another list.

# Boxes:

everything you see in the window browser it's inside boxes paragraph,title, lists, etc.
by default, a box is sized big enough to hold its counters of course you can change width and height with percentages or ems, pixels have been the most popular method to use  also you can give boxes
1. Border:
Every box has a border even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide

2. Margin:
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
the gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.

3. Padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents.

## and boxes in CSS you can give it more than that you can give border 

- border-image
- box shadow
- rounded corners
- elliptical shapes
and more than this

# Javascript

- IF else statement: .
in this statement, if the first code block resolves to false the second code block is run instead and if true it will run instead  

- switch statement: .
the switch statement is similar to if statement  but a switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value.  
and in the end, you have a default option that is run if none of the cases match

# LOOPS :
if the condition returns true a code block will keep running until the condition returns false and there are 3 types of loops:
1. FOR to run code a specific number of times

2. while: to keep code run 

3. do while: very similar to the do-while loop but has one key difference, it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once. even if the condition evaluates to false

# quick quiz

## ems have been the most popular method to use
- [ ] yes
- [x] no

## in If else statement if the first code block resolve trueit will run instead
- [x] yes
- [ ] no

## we use do-while loop to keep code run a speecific number of times
- [ ] yes
- [x] no
