# LINKS

LINK:
in every web page, we use the link to move from page to another page to write links we should but <a> tag and </a>tag and users can click on anything between this tags .

the text between the opening and closing tag is known as a link and it should explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it  .

* link to other site :
When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
the attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

* link to another page on the same site:
When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
the domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.

## Directory Structure


* Structure:

The diagram on the right shows
the directory structure for a
fictional entertainment listings
a website called ExampleArts.
The top-level folder is known
as the root folder. (In this
example, the root folder is called
examples.) The root folder
contains all of the other files and
folders for a website.
Each section of the site is placed
in a separate folder; this helps
organize the files.

* Relationships:

The relationship between
files and folders on a website
is described using the same
terminology as a family tree.
In the diagram on the right, you
can see some relationships have
been drawn in.
The examples folder is a
parent of the movies, music
and theater folders. And the
the movies, music, and theater
folders are children of the
examples folder.

* Homepage ges:

The main homepage of a site
written in HTML (and the
homepages of each section in a
child folder) is called index.html.
Web servers are usually set up
to return the index.html file if no
the filename is specified.
Therefore, if you enter
examplearts.com it will return
examplearts.com/index
.html, and examplearts.com/
music will return examples
.com/music/index.html.

* Relative URLs:

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

* Opening Links in
a New Window:

target:
If you want a link to open in 
a new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

* Linking to a Specific:

this you can help if you want to make a link for ex. for list on the top of the page to show something in the bottom of the page

* Building Blocks:

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

1. Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
```<h1> <p> <ul> <li>```

2. Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
```<img> <b> <i>```

* Containing Elements:

If one block-level element sits inside another the block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

* Controlling the
Position of Elements:

CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: 
1. normal flow, 
2. relative positioning
3. absolute positioning

 You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
 

* Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

* Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

* Page Sizes:
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:.

 
1. Greater efficiency:
It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.

2. Engaged collaboration:
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students:
Everyone has a different approach to problem-solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 

4. Social skills:
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. 

5. Job interview readiness:
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen  They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing codebase. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

6. Work environment readiness:
Many companies that utilize pair programming expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
